## debugging 🐛

there's a `.vscode` configuration that will trigger the `ms-edgedevtools.vscode-edge-devtools` plugin, to debug.

- need to install `microsoft-edge` navigator so the plugin will work properly
- go to `"Run and Debug"` or `Ctrl+Shift+D` and execute the `edge-debugger` config, but don't forgot to set your breakpoints and you're ready to go.

## runnning the app 🏃‍♀️

- if you have python (at least v2) already installed you could execute:

```shell
cd src/
python3 -m http.server 9000
```

- you could just open the file on your webrowser!

- or if you have microsoft edge plugin installed. use it!
